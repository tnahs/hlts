## [Beta Questions](#beta-questions)

While designing HLTS these are some questions we've come across. Have a thought or a response to one of them? [Contact Us!](/misc/contact) As more questions come up this section will be updated.

<br>

+ Are the Annotation fields `passage` `source` `author` `notes` `tags` and `collections` enough for entering and organizing Annotations?
+ Should Collections/Tags/Sources/Authors auto-remove themselves when they are un-used? or should there be an option to remove the un-used ones?
+ Is Markdown useful and if so, should it be toggled per annotation or for app as a whole?
+ Should the "Recent" page be populated by annotations from the past **number of days** taken from user settings or just a list of annotations arranged by recently created date?

## [Known Issues](#known-issues)

Some current quirks to note while using HLTS. None of these should cause any errors in functionality or loss of data. Found something not listed here? [Contact Us!](/misc/contact)

<br>

+ Dashboard Annotation count includes deleted items.
+ Annotation counts on Index pages (Collections/Tags/Sources/Authors) include deleted items.
+ Index does not list Annotations that have no `source` or `author`.
+ When using markdown and performing a search, `this passage` does not match `this ==passage==`.
+ Annotation editor textarea resets the scroll position of the page on input (keypress inside the textarea) when there's lots of text in editor.
+ Bulk Collection/Tag/Source/Author editor displays all items as "pinned" after single item is submitted. Hard refresh is required to show correct properties.
+ Searching certain odd strings such as `P : word` does some funky stuff with text highlighting the matches.
+ If Tag or Collection name does not start with a letter or number it will not appear on the Index page.
