## Beta Questions

==SECTION WIP==

<br>

1. Are the Annotation fields (passage, source, author, notes, tags and collections) enough for entering and organizing Annotations?
2. Should Collections/Tags/Sources/Authors auto-remove themselves when they are un-used? or should there be an option to remove the un-used ones?
3. Is Markdown useful and if so, should it be toggled per annotation or for app as a whole?
4. Should the "Recent" page be past **number of days** taken from user settings or just a list of annotations arranged by recently created date?

## Current Non-Critial Bugs

4. Dashboard annotation count includes deleted items.
5. Annotation counts on Index pages (Collections/Tags/Sources/Authors) include deleted items.
6. Index does not list annotations that have no `source` or `author`.
7. When using markdown and making a search, `this passage` does not match `this ==passage==`.
9. Annotation editor textarea resets the scroll position of the page on input (keypress inside the textarea) when there's lots of text in editor.
10. Bulk Collection/Tag/Source/Author editor displays all items as "pinned" after single item is submitted. Hard refresh is required to show correct properties.
11. Searching certain odd strings such as `P : word` does some funky stuff with text highlighting the matches.
