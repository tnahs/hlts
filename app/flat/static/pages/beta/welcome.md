title: Welcome to the HLTS Beta!

Thank you so much for participating in the HLTS Beta! Just a few quick things to note before starting and some things to keep in mind while using the app. Most of the challenge with HLTS up until this point has been setting up the core functionality of the app. Thus the hope for this beta is to help solve some functionality problems namely: *entering data* and *finding entered data* and finally *interacting with data*.

The more challenging problem to solve is entering data. In other words, *How can we make creating entries effortless?* The biggest roadblock with HLTS is the work that goes into entering an Annotation. It requires some effort at the moment and can be a barrier into actually using the app. However, HLTS comes with a simple API (see: [HLTS API](/manual/main/#api)) to enter annotations without opening a browser window allowing users to enter Annotations through, for example, an external mobile app or browser extensions. There are plans for a mobile HLTS app that would also support stripping and adding text from photographs/images. However this is planned for the distant future.

As for the second problem, HLTS provides three methods to find entered data: Tags, Collections and a custom search syntax (see: [Searching Annotations](/manual/main/#searching-annotations)). Tags and Collections work roughly in the same way, however, serve two separate functions, namely: Tags as "topic markers" and Collections as "project folders". (see: [Tags and Collections](/manual/main/#tags-and-collections)) However the question would be: *Are there better or more efficient / useful / interesting ways of finding data?*

And finally, interacting with data. One of the original intentions behind HLTS was to make it possible to interact or re-interact with the saved Annotations. With a physical book it's possible and sometimes preferable to just flip through and find a quick passage to read. To emulate this, the [Random Annotation/Tag](/random/default) page was created. However, it's not very interactive or smart. So: *Is there a good way to stumble across an Annotation without having to explicitly search for it?* Or is this even a good question?

And a quick word on the UI. Most of the focus on this beta has been to get the inner workings up and running. As a result the UI is rather under-developed. (HLTS is semi-mobile-friendly, so certain things might not display properly.) For the moment it's purpose is to be clear and utilitarian. There are many ideas for a more slick and responsive UI, but that's for future releases.

That's it for the essentials! Oh and, what does "HLTS" mean? It's a shorted version of "highlights". It's the "code name" for the app, but not at all the final name which is open for suggestions. Likewise for any other element from the API to database model to the UI. All the work you see is a "work in progress" and very much open for critique and feedback so please don't hesitate to contact us with your questions/comments!
