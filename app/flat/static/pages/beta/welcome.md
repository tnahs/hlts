title: Welcome to the HLTS Beta!

Thank you so much for participating in the HLTS Beta! Most of the challenge with HLTS up until this point has been setting up the core functionality. Thus the hope for this beta is to help solve some functionality problems namely: *entering data* and *finding entered data* and finally *interacting with data*.

As for the second problem, HLTS provides three methods to find entered data: Tags, Collections and a custom search syntax (see: [Searching Annotations](/manual/main/#searching-annotations)). Tags and Collections work roughly in the same way, however, serve two separate functions, namely: Tags as "topic markers" and Collections as "project folders". (see: [Tags and Collections](/manual/main/#tags-and-collections)) However the question would be: *Are there better or more efficient / useful / interesting ways of finding data?*

And finally, interacting with data. One of the original intentions behind HLTS was to make it possible to interact or re-interact with the saved Annotations. With a physical book it's possible and sometimes preferable to just flip through and find a quick passage to read. To emulate this, the [Random Annotation/Tag](/random/default) page was created. However, it's not very interactive or smart. So: *Is there a good way to stumble across an Annotation without having to explicitly search for it?* Or is this even a good question?

And a quick word on the UI. Most of the focus on this beta has been to get the inner workings up and running. As a result the UI is rather under-developed. (HLTS is semi-mobile-friendly, so certain things might not display properly.) For the moment it's purpose is to be clear and utilitarian. There are many ideas for a more slick and responsive UI, but that's for future releases.

That's it for the essentials! Oh and, what does "HLTS" mean? It's a shortened version of "highlights". It's the "code name" for the app, but not at all set in stone. Likewise for any other element from the API to database model to the UI. All the work you see is a "work in progress" and very much open for critique and feedback so please don't hesitate to contact us with your questions/comments!

Thanks!
