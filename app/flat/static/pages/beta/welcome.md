title: Welcome to the HLTS Beta!

<br>

Thank you so much for participating and welcome to the HLTS Beta! What started out as a desire to extract annotations from Apple Books evolved into a sort of online "commonplace book":

>Commonplace books are a way to compile knowledge, [...] essentially scrapbooks filled with items of every kind: recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs, prayers, legal formulas. [...] Each commonplace book is unique to its creator's particular interests.

>[Wikipedia - Commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book)

Although HLTS only supports text at this time, structurally it's intended to be free-form. Add text from wherever you see fit and the app will organize it based on four categories: `tags` `collections` `sources` and `authors`. Each of these categories are indexed (see: [HLTS index](/index)) for easy access. There are various other ways passages are organized but like the index they are all works in progress. The hope in the end is to create a design that makes interacting with passages near effortless. Be it inputting passages or accessing them. Take for example accessing, would it be possible to come up with a system that promotes organization alongside one that promotes spontaneity?

For example, there have been discussions on building an associative system that scans passage text, searches out keywords and suggests otherwise un-related passages based on these keywords. Essentially building a bit of a rabbit hole into your own passages, jumping from one passage to another based on loose, literal associations. Currently `tags` are used to simulate this but they can be some work to organize, however this system would make it somewhat automated.

Therefore the hope for the beta is to answer these few questions. More concisely put: *Is it useful?* If not, are there any glaring roadblocks preventing you from using it? And if you do find it useful, are there any features or changes that would make it more effective? In other words, *Is there a better way to interact with the data?*

A quick side-note on creating Annotations (see: [Annotations](/manual/main/#annotations)). In HLTS, Annotations can be added manually or by using the API which provides two endpoints to input data remotely and in bulk. Opening up the possibility to write sibling apps on any platform that could communicate with HLTS (see: [HLTS API](/manual/main/#api)).

<br>

And finally a word on the UI. Most of the focus on this beta has been to get the inner workings up and running. As a result the UI has been polished to an "okay" finish. HLTS is semi-mobile-friendly, so certain things might not display properly. For the moment its purpose is to be clear and utilitarian. If you have any ideas for a more slick and interactive UI, then please don't hesitate to send in a suggestion.

<br>

That's it for the essentials! Oh and, what does "HLTS" mean? It's a shortened version of "highlights". It's the "codename" for the app, but not at all the final name, which is open for suggestions. Likewise for any other element from the API to the database model to the UI. All the work you see is a "work in progress" and very much open for critique and feedback, your comments and suggestions are highly valuable, so please don't hesitate to send any!
