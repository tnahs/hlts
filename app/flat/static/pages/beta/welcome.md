title: Welcome to the HLTS Beta!

Thank you so much for participating in the HLTS Beta! Just a few quick things to note before starting and some things to keep in mind while using the app. Most of the challenge with HLTS up until this point has been setting up the core functionality of the app. Thus the hope for this beta is to help solve some functionality problems namely: *entering data* and *finding entered data*.


The more challenging problem to solve is entering data. In other words, *How can we make creating entries effortless?* The biggest roadblock with HLTS is the work that goes into entering an Annotation. It requires some effort at the moment and can be a barrier into actually using the app. However, HLTS comes with a simple API (see: [HLTS API](/manual/main/#api)) to enter annotations without opening a browser window allowing users to enter Annotations through, for example, an external mobile app or browser extensions.


As for the second problem, HLTS provides three methods to find entered data: Tags, Collections and a custom search syntax (see: [Searching Annotations](/manual/main/#searching-annotations)). Tags and Collections work roughly in the same way, however, serve two separate functions, namely: Tags as "topic markers" and Collections as "project folders". (see: [Tags and Collections](/manual/main/#tags-and-collections))


A final word on the UI. Most of the focus on this beta has been to get the inner workings up and running. As a result the UI is rather under-developed. (HLTS does not have a mobile-friendly UI but it will work on mobile, however, certain things might not display properly.) For the moment it's purpose is to be clear and utilitarian. We've got many ideas for a more slick and responsive UI, but that's for future releases.

<br>

That's it for the essentials! And note, every designed element from the database model to the UI is "work in progress" and very much open for critique and feedback so please don't hesitate to contact us with your questions/comments!

Thanks!
