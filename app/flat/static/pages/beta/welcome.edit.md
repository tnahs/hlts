Welcome to the HLTS Beta!

<br>

If you do run across a bug or any sort of quirky behavior please [report it](/misc/contact)!

<br>

App will take a second to wake up.

<br>

light patching will be done

<br>

And a quick word on the UI. Most of the focus on this beta has been to get the inner workings up and running. As a result the UI is rather under-developed. (HLTS is semi-mobile-friendly, so certain things might not display properly.) For the moment its purpose is to be clear and utilitarian. There are many ideas for a more slick and responsive UI, but that's for future releases.

<br>

That's it for the essentials! Oh and, what does "HLTS" mean? It's a shorted version of "highlights". It's the "codename" for the app, but not at all the final name which is open for suggestions. Likewise for any other element from the API to database model to the UI. All the work you see is a "work in progress" and very much open for critique and feedback so please don't hesitate to send any!

<br>

Thanks!
The HLTS Team
