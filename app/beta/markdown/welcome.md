#### Tags and Collections

<br>

#### Search Syntax

<br>


#### Known Bugs

1. Dashboard annotation count includes deleted items.
2. Annotation counts on Index pages (Collections/Tags/Sources/Authors) include deleted items.
3. Index does not list annotations that have no `source` or `author`.
4. When using markdown and making a search, `this passage` does not match `this ==passage==`.
5. Searching `source:` and/or `author:` requires placing wildcards `*` around the query otherwise it looks for exact matches.
6. Annotation editor texarea resets the scroll position of the page on input (keypress inside the textarea) when there's lots of text in editor.
7. Bulk Collection/Tag/Source/Author editor displays all items as "pinned" after single item is submitted. Hard refresh is required to show correct properties.
8. Searching certain odd strings such as `P : word` does some funky stuff with text highlighting the matches.

#### Beta Questions

List of questions!

1. Should Collections/Tags/Sources/Authors auto-remove themselves when they are un-used? or should we have a function to remove the un-used ones?
2. Is Markdown useful and if so, should it be toggled per annotation or for app as a whole?
3. Should the "Recent" page be past _n_ days taken from user settings or just a list of annotations arranged by recently created date?
